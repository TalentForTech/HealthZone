# Healthzone
Balance can't be taken for granted past a certain age; it must be maintained — both in mind and body.


## Inspiration💭
In a digital world affected by COVID-19, digital diagnosis and fitness both mental and physical is more necessary than ever. The pandemic has caused an influx in hospital cases, and the limitations on hospital beds have people wondering whether their symptoms are severe enough to warrant a doctor's appointment. Meanwhile, others experience ailments but are unable to afford a visit to the doctor due to a lack of or poor health care.

## What it does❓
Healthzone is a webapp that allows users to regularly check up on their physical and mental well-being without needing to visit a doctor unless needed and enjoy AR/VR fitness demos.

## How we built it💻
The frontend of our website was built using HTML, CSS and JS. WE used MySQL for our database. The backend of our webpage was built using PHP. We used various API's like symptomchecker, faceapi and spotify API to do the corresponding task. We also used twilio to send messages and the chatbot was built using JQuery.

## Challenges we ran into🚀
We were racing against time. Building a good UI with all kinds of functioning of different APIs and integrating each of them according to our user's need was indeed a big challenge for us. There were a variety of bugs to fix till the last moment. Implementing AR/VR through echoAR was also very difficult due to various errors showing up.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of🏆
It was nice to see work together even when doing everything virtually. In the beginning, we underestimated the difficulty of making HealthZone, but we ran into many challenges along the way, so it was awesome to see how it all played out in the end.

## What we learned🏫
Through this project, we learned a lot about echoAR. We also learned about teamwork since we had to do everything virtually. We learned to efficiently divide tasks so everyone had something to do and we finished the project in time.
